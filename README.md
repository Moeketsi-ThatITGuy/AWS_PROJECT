# Building Scalable Applications on AWS: A Journey from Configuration to Stress TestingBuilding Scalable Applications on AWS: A Journey from Configuration to Stress Testing

Scaling applications effectively is a cornerstone of cloud architecture. In this project, I set out to design, implement, and stress-test a scalable application using AWS services. From configuring an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) to troubleshooting scaling triggers and optimizing performance, this journey was filled with lessons on building reliable and efficient cloud infrastructure.
This write-up captures the full process, including setup, challenges, solutions, and key takeaways, offering insights for anyone looking to explore AWS's scaling capabilities
